# EPO BDDS Bulk File Loader

Welcome to the EPO BDDS Bulk File Loader project! This repository is part of a series of open-source initiatives launched from [patent.dev](patent.dev/projects). My goal is to create a tool that simplifies loading large-scale patent data files from the European Patent Office’s Bulk Data Delivery Service (BDDS) API. This resource aims to support developers, patent researchers, and analysts in working more efficiently with EPO data.

## Project purpose

The EPO’s BDDS provides extensive patent data files that are crucial for various analyses but challenging to manage due to their size and structure. This project aims to create a streamlined tool that loads these files, enabling easier integration of EPO patent data into workflows and applications for analysis and research.

## Why is this repository empty?

To gauge community interest, I’m using GitHub stars and forks as indicators of demand:

-	100 Stars – If this repository reaches 100 stars, it will signal enough interest to justify starting the project.
-	10 Forks – When at least 10 users fork this repository, it shows there’s a group interested in contributing.

Once these thresholds are met, I’ll begin implementing the tool and updating the repository with our progress.

## How you can help

If this project sounds valuable to you, here’s how you can show your support:

-	Star the Repository – Show your interest in seeing this project come to life.
-	Fork the Repository – If you’re interested in contributing, please fork it! This will signal a readiness within the community to build this tool together.

Thank you for considering this project! With enough support, we can create a valuable resource for the patent community. For more project ideas, visit [patent.dev](patent.dev/projects).
